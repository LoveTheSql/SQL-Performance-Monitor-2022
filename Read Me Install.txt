Install the databases first.
Install the DATA for Metrics next.
Open the Visual Studio Project and revise DataSource for your need.
TEST


Occassionally I may upload additional scripts with fixes or more Metric definitions.
When creating your own Metrics, I suggest that you create them AFTER the ID numbers I have reserved. Theat way a later update shouldn't overwrite any custom Metrics you create.
